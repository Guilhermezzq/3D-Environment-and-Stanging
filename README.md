# Project Description
This project is a demonstration of an interactive environment and scene using technologies such as Three.js, React Three Fiber, and Drei. It presents a three-dimensional scene with support for custom environments and scenarios, creating an immersive experience for users.

# Key Features:
Ambient Light and Directional Light: The project incorporates ambient and directional lighting to create realistic lighting effects in the scene.
Shadows: Uses shadows to add depth and realism to the scene, providing a sense of presence to rendered objects.
OrbitControls: Implements interactive camera controls, allowing users to navigate the scene intuitively.
useHelper: Facilitates object positioning and alignment in the scene, providing helper tools for guidance during development.
Drei Helpers: Leveraging the utilities available in Drei to simplify common tasks, such as creating grids, axes, and other auxiliary elements.
Spearkles: Integrates visual effects like sparkling particles to add detail and dynamism to the scene.
Sky, Clouds, and Stars: Includes atmospheric elements such as sky, clouds, and stars to create an immersive and captivating environment.
Environment Map and HDR Images: Incorporates environment maps using files and HDR images to render materials with high fidelity and realism.
### Custom Environment and LightFormer: Allows customization of the environment and lighting, enabling the creation of unique and engaging atmospheres.
